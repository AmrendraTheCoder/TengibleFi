+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+-------------------+

Relationships:
- loanIdToCollateralTokenId[loanId] => tokenId
- loans[tokenId] => LoanData (loan info for that NFT)
- accountToLoans[accountTokenId] => loanId
- userLoans[address] => loanId[]
- User[address][tokenId] => UserAccount (Auth info for user/NFT)

Key Flows:
- User mints account NFT (accountTokenId) and collateral NFT (tokenId)
- User creates loan: links accountTokenId, tokenId, generates loanId
- Loan data is stored in loans[tokenId], indexed by loanId and accountTokenId
- All mappings allow lookup from any ID to related data


ðŸŽ¯ Without accountTokenId
Alice's wallet = 0x123

She takes loans â†’ userLoans[0x123] = [loan1, loan2]

She loses the wallet? ðŸ”¥ All loan access gone forever.

ðŸŽ¯ With accountTokenId
Alice mints NFT â†’ accountTokenId = 101

Loan stored as â†’ accountToLoans[101] = loan1

She transfers NFT to new wallet â†’ âœ… All loan access moves with it.

Can even give it to someone else â†’ like selling/transferring an account.
